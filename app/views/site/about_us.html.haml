        %h1 Cleaning has never been easier!
      %h3 <strong>Maid In Sheffield</strong>
      %h6 Maid In Sheffield was started by a team of graduates who wanted an easy way to book a good cleaning service  without a load of hassle. We noticed that it was almost impossible to book a maid online in Sheffield and loads of places wanted to come round for a quote. We thought that was too much bother!
      %h3 <strong>What We Do</strong>
      %h6 We Clean! And we do it well! So well in fact that we guarantee all our work. We work like this: you book online and we turn up. Simple as that. No need for us to come round and quote for you, no up-selling and no contract necessary.
      %h3 <strong>Where We're Based</strong>
      %h6 We're based in Sheffield and currently serve the city of Sheffield and its suburbs, we hope to expand soon to be able to service the other parts of the wider South Yorkshire area. <br> We currently serve postcodes S1 through S20 inclusive, and S35.
      %h3 <strong>Why Does Maid In Sheffield Exist?</strong>
      %h6 Our mission is to make sure you get the best clean as easily as possible. We have a team of dedicated professional cleaners who are fully insured and background checked to make you feel absolutely assured you're receiving an elite service. The Made in Sheffield mark has indicated quality steel for centuries, and Maid In Sheffield indicates a quality domestic service. We wanted to build a company where people could book online quickly and easily and not need to go through a long process of making phone calls to organise their cleaning, and then not being sure what they're going to get.
