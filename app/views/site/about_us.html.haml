        %h1 Cleaning has never been easier!
      %h3 <strong><br>Who Are We?</strong>
      %h6 Maid In Sheffield was started in early 2014 as a small, local business that wanted to connect better with its customers than its large competitors. We are a living wage employer, and won't cut costs when it comes to hiring our staff. We wanted to change the way people thought about their home cleaning and how it should be done. We wanted to make it easier to book a clean, easier to know how much it would cost, an avoid the hassle that comes with a home visit just for a quote. We know that time is important to you, and we wanted to save you as much of it as possible.
      %h3 <strong><br>What Do We Do?</strong>
      %h6 We take your booking for a clean online after you've chosen exactly what you would like done. We confirm your booking with you and then on the day and time that you've chosen we show up and get to work. We leave a small gift at the end of each clean and a list of all the things we've done that day, checked off so you know that what you've asked for is what we've done. Finally, we check back with you a few days after your clean to make sure you're completely satisfied with our service.
      %h3 <strong><br>Where Do We Serve?</strong>
      %h6 We currently serve Sheffield and its outlying villages such as Dore and Totley. We serve all postcodes from S1 to S20 inclusive, and S35. Soon we will be expanding out to the rest of South Yorkshire and North Derbyshire.
